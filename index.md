Hello there, (*cue the Obi Wan Kenobi memes*ðŸ˜‰) I am Ajith.

I am a data scientist, a machine learning engineer, and a software engineer. My interests are in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Python, and Backend Engineering.

In August 2024, I joined [Master of Computer Science (MCS)](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/academics/graduate/degrees/mcs.php) program at [North Carolina State University (NCSU)](https://www.ncsu.edu), Raleigh, NC, USA.

Before that, I worked at [Elastiq](https://www.elastiq.ai) as a software engineer. Elastiq is an early-stage B2B AI startup focusing on both generative AI and applied AI solutions.

Before joining Elastiq, I was a data scientist at [Mavenir](https://www.mavenir.com), where I worked extensively on developing [Reinforcement Learning (RL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) applications for 5G and 4G cellular networks. Mavenir is a telecommunications software vendor and one of the leading advocates for adopting [OpenRAN standards and specifications](https://www.o-ran.org/specifications) across the industry.

Prior to kickstarting my career at Mavenir, I studied [PG-DAI (Post Graduate Diploma in Artificial Intelligence)](https://www.cdac.in/index.aspx?id=DAC&courseid=30) at [CDAC, Pune](https://www.cdac.in/index.aspx?id=PN). Even before that, I did B.Tech (Bachelor of Technology) in CSE (Computer Science and Engineering) at [VIT (Vellore Institute of Technology), Vellore](https://vit.ac.in/).
